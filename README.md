# LSD-Jumper (Latino Salsa Dancer - Jumper)

### Welcome to our little SDL project named LSD-Jumper!

Inspired by a game called Icy Tower :-)

We chose SDL because is a powerful cross-platform development library that provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick etc..
The challenges were worth it and with the knowlegde that we gained we can gladly keep working on more projects with SDL and c++. 

Adding the libraries on our project went pretty much well execpt of one confusion that we had with github while we both pushing the same things all over again.
